# rematch_practice_tool
 A small little TTS directional practice tool I've made for the game REMATCH.

 Choose a difficulty and mode, and the tool will randomly announce directions at intervals. This is ideal for improving your reaction time when responding to in-game actions, such as passing in a specific  
 direction (e.g., pass left).
